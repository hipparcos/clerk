The clerk development environment is composed by 3 containers:
    - app: php-fpm;
    - web: nginx;
    - database: mariadb.

The site is available at:
    127.0.0.1:8080

Your .env file must match the database configuration of docker-compose.yml.
    DB_DATABASE=clerk
    DB_USERNAME=clerk
    DB_PASSWORD=secret

How to build/run:
    $ docker-compose -f [path_to_docker-compose] build
    $ docker-compose -f [path_to_docker-compose] up

Take care to fix permissions so the app container can write to `storage/logs`.
    $ chmod 777 storage/logs
UID and GID outputed by this command must match your UID and GID:
    $ docker-compse -f [path_to_docker-compose.yml] exec app ls -la storage/logs
If not, modify app.dockerfile accordingly.

To call command on the app container:
	$ docker-compose -f [path_to_docker-compose.yml] exec app [command]

Add this function to your .bashrc (set CLERK_ROOT to the clerk directory):
    export CLERK_ROOT=
    function clerk-dev() {
        ( cd $CLERK_ROOT && docker-compose -f config/docker-dev/docker-compose.yml $* )
    }
You can now manage your environment by calling clerk-dev. Example:
    $ clerk-dev up
    $ clerk-dev exec app php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
